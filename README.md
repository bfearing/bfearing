## ðŸ‘‹ About me
Hi, I'm Brandon! I'm an entrepreneurial-minded, design engineer living in Asheville, NC. I'm obsessed with the placement of colored pixels, engrossed in the creator economy, and fascinated by shiny cardboard collectibles.

### ðŸ’¼ Professionally
I've worked on a wide-range of projects in several different industries. I've machined pipes for nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines, tested actuarial financial systems, developed nationwide transit mobile applications, designed blockchain-based applications for the U.S. Government, led UX in website migrations for the State of Ohio, and founded a few startups along the way.

### ðŸŽ“  Educationally
I graduated with a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech, as well as minored in Business and Industrial Design. My education laid the foundation for how I perceive, research, and approach problems: opportunity-minded, user-driven, and process-oriented.

### ðŸ”¥  Personally
I enjoy working on micro-saas products in the creator economy space, getting my hands dirty in my small-but-mighty woodshop, staying active out on the golf course and hockey rink, and collecting a variety of trading cards. I'm also on a decades long endeaver of learning Japanese and a new venture of working out consistently on the rowing machine.

My mantra these days tends to be, do what makes you happy today. These past few years have taught me life is too short and too uncertain to spend it in pursuit of a better tomorrow.
